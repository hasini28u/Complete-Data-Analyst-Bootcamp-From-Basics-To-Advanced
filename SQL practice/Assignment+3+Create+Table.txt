3.ANSWERS :

-- Find the names of employees whose first names start with the letter 'J'.
-- The LIKE operator is used for pattern matching.
-- The '%' wildcard matches any sequence of characters.
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE FirstName LIKE 'J%';


-- Find the names of employees whose last names end with the letter 'n'.
-- The '%' wildcard at the beginning of the pattern matches any characters before the 'n'.
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE LastName LIKE '%n';


-- Find the email addresses of employees that contain the word "john".
-- The '%' wildcard at both the beginning and end of the pattern finds "john" anywhere in the string.
SELECT Email
FROM Employees
WHERE Email LIKE '%john%';


-- Find the names of employees whose first names have exactly 5 characters.
-- The '_' wildcard matches exactly one character. Five underscores mean exactly five characters.
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE FirstName LIKE '_____';


--Find the names of employees whose last names contain the letter 'a' as the second character.
-- The '_' wildcard matches the first character, and the '%' wildcard matches any characters after 'a'.
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE LastName LIKE '_a%';
